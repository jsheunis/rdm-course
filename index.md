The aim of this workshop is to present a set of good practices in
research data management, explain version control, and to introduce
the core features of DataLad software - a data management multitool
that can assist in handling the entire life cycle of digital
objects. We will tackle issues ranging from “what is a good file name”
to “how to publish a version-controlled dataset”.

The exercises will provide an opportunity to gain hands-on experience
with using DataLad to create a basic dataset, track its changes over
time, and publish its contents. You will also learn how to use data
created by others and collaborate on datasets. The exercises will be
based around toy examples, but all operations will be relevant for
real-world data management.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> The workshop will be based around code-along exercises, however no
> experience with programming, command line, or version control is
> required.
>
> [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/) (G-Node Infrastructure) platform will
> be used for dataset publication during the Remote Collaboration
> module. In order to fully complete the exercises, you will need to
> [sign up](https://gin.g-node.org/user/sign_up) for a GIN account,
> which requires a username, password, and a valid e-mail address
> (institutional e-mails are recommended to benefit from the full set
> of features).
